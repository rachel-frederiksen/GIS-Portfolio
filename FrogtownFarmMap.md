# Assignment: Build a Custom Google Map for a Non-Profit Organization

## Frogtown Farm
I chose the non-profit Frogtown Farm, located in the neighborhood of Frogtown in St Paul, Minnesota. They label themselves as an "urban demonstration farm", or a place where residents can join a community of justice, resiliency, and healing all through farming. More about their story can be found on their [website](https://www.frogtownfarm.org/our-story).

### Bid
Part of the assignment was to outline a one-page bid detailing our predicted work time, our actual worktime, and any reflections we have. That bid can be found below.

## Chosen Color Palette

I took this screenshot off the Frogtown Farm's Facebook page, and used the [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) tool to get a color palette adequate for the website. The hex codes, as seen in the image below, were used for the customized map build.

## Map Build
For the actual build, I used Google Map's style wizard. To start, I chose the **Retro** for my base theme as it already had a similar color palette. While I would be changing the colors, having some existing framework for how tans, yellows, and greens looked against each other was helpful when deciding which colors would be used for which features. As such, I have created a look up table that highlights all visible aspects of the map including their feature, element, and style information. That information is in the table below.

This styling has created a neutral map that works with Frogtown Farm's overall theme: a neutral, earthy tone. The following images are of this customized map at varying zoom levels that are applicable to users interested in this organization.

### Image 1
This first image shows a close-up zoom of Frogtown Farm, including both the office space as well as the actual plot of land. This level of detail would allow users to find the specific directions necessary to get to the exact location if they were in somewhat close proximity. This level of detail also allows users to see the general overview of the property.

### Image 2
This second image shows as wider zoom of the neighborhood as well as others nearby. This level of detail allows users to locate where Frogtown is in proxomity to other major locations or neighborhoods.

### Image 3
The third image shows the widest, yet still applicable, zoom of St Paul and Minneapolis (otherwise known as the Twin Cities). This level of detail allows users to locate Frogtown in the context of the cities at large, though this scope would only be helpful after the use of one of the previous images due to its scale.

### Disclaimer
A dynamic map would be most beneficial for Frogtown Farm as it is a single destination, and residents come from a variety of distances across the area. However, for the purposes of this assignment, the static images can also be helpful. 

## JSON Code
To access the JSON code with these style specifications, **[CLICK HERE](/FrogtownCustomMap.json)**.

## Further Instructions

*To Use the JSON Code...*
1. Copy the code off the link above.
2. To save to a JSON file for later use, paste the code into a text/source code editor tool. I recommend [Sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/).
3. Save the file as a JSON file.

*To Upload the JSON Code into the Google Maps Style Wizard...*
1. Copy the JSON code from above OR off your saved JSON file.
2. Open the [Google Maps Style Wizard](https://mapstyle.withgoogle.com/)
3. Click the three stacked dots on the blue banner that reads "Create map style"
4. Click "Import JSON"
5. Paste JSON code into the applicable space
6. Click "Import JSON"

These instructions allow access to the specific styling. Further steps beyond the scope of Phase 1 in this assignment would need to be taken to embed a dynamic map on Frogtown Farm's website.
