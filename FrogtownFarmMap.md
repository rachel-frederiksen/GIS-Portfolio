# Assignment: Build a Custom Google Map for a Non-Profit Organization

## Frogtown Farm
I chose the non-profit Frogtown Farm, located in the neighborhood of Frogtown in St Paul, Minnesota. They label themselves as an "urban demonstration farm", or a place where residents can join a community of justice, resiliency, and healing all through farming. More about their story can be found on their [website](https://www.frogtownfarm.org/our-story).

## Chosen Color Palette

I took this screenshot off the Frogtown Farm's Facebook page, and used the [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) tool to get a color palette adequate for the website. The hex codes, as seen in the image below, were used for the customized map build.
