# Assignment: Build a Custom Google Map for a Non-Profit Organization

## Frogtown Farm
I chose the non-profit Frogtown Farm, located in the neighborhood of Frogtown in St Paul, Minnesota. They label themselves as an "urban demonstration farm", or a place where residents can join a community of justice, resiliency, and healing all through farming. More about their story can be found on their [website](https://www.frogtownfarm.org/our-story).

### Bid
Part of the assignment was to outline a one-page bid detailing our predicted work time, our actual worktime, and any reflections we have. That bid can be found below.

## Chosen Color Palette

I took this screenshot off the Frogtown Farm's Facebook page, and used the [Adobe Color](https://color.adobe.com/create/image) tool to get a color palette adequate for the website. The hex codes, as seen in the image below, were used for the customized map build.

## Map Build
For the actual build, I used Google Map's style wizard. To start, I chose the **Retro** for my base theme as it already had a similar color palette. While I would be changing the colors, having some existing framework for how tans, yellows, and greens looked against each other was helpful when deciding which colors would be used for which features. As such, I have created a look up table that highlights all visible aspects of the map including their feature, element, and style information. That information is in the table below.
