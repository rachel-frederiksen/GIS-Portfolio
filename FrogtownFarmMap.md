# Assignment: Build a Custom Google Map for a Non-Profit Organization

## Frogtown Farm
I chose the non-profit Frogtown Farm, located in the neighborhood of Frogtown in St Paul, Minnesota. They label themselves as an "urban demonstration farm", or a place where residents can join a community of justice, resiliency, and healing all through farming. More about their story can be found on their [website](https://www.frogtownfarm.org/our-story).
