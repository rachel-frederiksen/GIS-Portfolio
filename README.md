My online portfolio for the Advanced GIS course at CMU

## About Me
Hello! My name is Rachel Frederiksen, and I use she/they pronouns. I'm a second-year student at Heinz College of Information Systerms and Public Policy. I'm getting a Master's of Science in Public Policy and Management. My areas of policy research are in rural and agricultural development, but I am also interested in equity projects regarding organized labor, tenant rights, and social services. I went to the University of Minnesota Duluth for undergrad where I majored in Political Science and Communication, and also minored in Philosophy. I did a lot of campaign work throughout undergrad in the form of campus organizing as well as formally within a local political party unit. I spent this past summer working in digital production for a digital political strategy firm called Trilogy Interactive where I did quite a bit of HTML/Markdown coding as well as some database management, social media management, and strategy building sessions.

I'm originally from a rural community in Northeastern Wisconsin, but I also grew up on my grandparents' cattle ranch turned alfalfa farm in the Upper Peninsula (UP) of Michigan. Personally, I really enjoy making playlists for my commute to and from campus, spending time with my friends at Heinz, and watching college hockey.

## What I Hope to Learn
By far, the full semester GIS course was one of my favorite courses at Heinz. I want to expand my experience and move into the workforce in this field. I hope Advanced GIS provides me the applicable skills so I can connect my interest in GIS to my future in the workplace. I am most interested in developing my ability to self-manage my own GIS work as well as expanding my skills with more advanced tools. I ultimately hope to work with GIS in my career post-graduation this May, so I hope to take all of the skills forward into that potential job.
